            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What I haue ſwept out that was in that, what I haue newly added vnto this
<pb facs="tcp:17936:3"/> I haue prefaced to the Reader. I haue enough for all my paines, if the Prayers which I haue added will ſerue at any time to ſtirre vp the leaſt fire or ſparke of deuotion in any Chriſtian heart: but for the Meditations <hi>I</hi> can neuer ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: ſo heauenly, ſo pithy, ſo feeling, and ſo quicke, that he that reades or heares them, if he haue any life of grace in him, ſhall feele them not only pleaſing to his taſte and ſweet vnto his eare, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his affections alſo, and work<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing on his heart.</p>
            <p>Now, that this booke is named vnto your Honour from the man that you haue not known, may be an imputation of my great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that haue dared to offer it, will bee an intimation of your greater goodnes vouchſafing to accept it: This may your Honour pardon in mee, that ſhal I praiſe in
<pb facs="tcp:17936:3"/> you; and yet there are ſome reaſons that haue inclined me hereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to. For beſides the aduice of my friends herein, that are people of your knowledge, two things as iuſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, haue induced me thus to do.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hauing liued ſome yeeres in the place neere, where your Honor kept your reſidence; and hearing diuers well-affected people teſtifie of your loue to religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your pious heart, and godly conuerſation, I thought good in this liuing and liues like Booke, to giue a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof alſo to the men of this age, and to the people that ſhall come hereafter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe I could not chuſe but do, as I thinke all other did, that either knew your perſon, or had heard of your Honourable name; and knowne your ſorrow, namely, condole you in your loſſe I thought the comforts of this
<pb facs="tcp:17936:4"/> Booke would befit your mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which ſpeakes oppoſitely to that purpoſe, as in other places, <hi>viz</hi> the exerciſe of the firſt and ſeuenth dayes, ſo eſpecially in the two and thirtieth Meditation: you will thinke when you reade it, that it was meant and written purpoſely for your comfort.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak out of experience of mine owne affliction, when the Lord of late had made many ſorrowes to lay hold of mee at once, and brought vpon mee breaking vpon breaking, like the waues of the Sea, one in the necke of another: after hee had plucktout of my boſome, and ſlaine the<note n="a" place="margin">Who died the <hi>19</hi> of <hi>Auguſt 1614.</hi>

For, as the end of Phyſicke is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, to maintaine health in mans body, and to recouer the ſame when it is loſt: ſo Diuinity, in reſpect of the diſeaſes of the ſoule, after the ſame manner doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a double end: for it ſhewes not onely how wee may be freed from ſinnes, but alſo how wee may bee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in grace. Both Phyſickes, as well that of the body, as that of the ſoule are of God, as ſaid <hi>Gregory,</hi> therefore alſo they
<pb facs="tcp:17936:6"/> agree in the Author. Phyſike hath her certain principles: that is to ſay, Reaſon, and experience, which for that are called certain legs thereof, with which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth that which is agreeable, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that which is diſagreeing: ſo Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath her ſure and vnmoued princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, the Word of God, comprehended in the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, with which that which agrees, ſhe doth accept of, that which diſagrees, ſhe doth refuſe. Others goe further, &amp; ſhew, that all true Phyſike is of regeneration, ſeeing that nothing can regenerate which is not it ſelfe regenerated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the cleanſing of the vitall ſpirits from the impure tinctures of diſeaſes, which is as it were a certaine regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are required regenerated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that is, ſpirits which are bodies ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall for penetration and tincture: and neuertheleſſe they are all ſpirits corpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reall: ſo alſo the true end of Diuinity is, that ſpirituall regeneration of the inward man, which the Truth doth teſtifie to bee made of Water and the Spirit. They adde alſo the compariſon of the Philoſophers ſtone, with the bleſſed ſtone in the Church: but becauſe this is neither knowne of all, nor granted of all, I will
<pb facs="tcp:17936:6"/> not dwell on theſe things, it is ſufficient for my purpoſe, that out of the compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Diuinity with Phyſike, I can gather by very good reaſon, that Diuinity is a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike doctrine: and therefore that they do not iudge aright, which contend that it is onely ſpeculatiue, which in number are ſome of theſe Schoole men; for although not onely thoſe things that are to bee done, but alſo which are to bee beleeued and hoped for, are propoſed vnto vs in this heauenly Philoſophy, yet that doth not hinder, but it may as yet bee called practike, for Phyſike alſo is occuped in the Theory of certaine things, neither yet is therefore a ſpeculatiue diſcipline, becauſe it followes this ſame Theory by reaſon of practice, and in order to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: ſo is it in Diuinity; yea, I may adde, that in thoſe very things that are to bee beleeued, or in the Articles of the Faith, there is required not bare knowledge onely, but alſo conſent, which that it is an action of the part of the will, they doe confirme by fit arguments to whom this care doth appertaine.</p>
            <p>Now, if Diuinity bee a practike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, then the end thereof ſhall not bee bare knowledge and ſubtile Theory, but rather practice. If ye know theſe things,
<pb facs="tcp:17936:7"/> bleſſed are ye, if ye do them, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour to his Diſciples. The matters of our Religion doe not conſiſt in words, but in deeds, ſaith <hi>Iuſtin.</hi> Not to talke onely, but alſo to be, makes Chriſtians, ſaith <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The ſumme of Chriſtian Religion is to imitate him whom thou worſhippeſt, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> What is Chriſtianity? The likeneſſe of God according to that which befals the nature of man, ſaith <hi>Baſil.</hi> Now if the end and perfection of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bee not a bare knowledge, but a practiſe, how few true Chriſtians ſhalt thou finde at this day? there is euery where much ſcience, little conſcience. It is very well done that the Orthodoxe doctrine is defended by Bookes, Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sermons, and all manner of meanes, but we muſt alſo doe our endeuour, that our life may anſwer to the Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. If I haue the knowledge of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and haue not loue, I am nothing, ſaith the Apoſtle. What then ſhall they anſwere hereafter, which haue not the knowledge of all, but of few? not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but a very ſlender knowledge of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and yet they are proud of it; they contemne others, they enuy others, ſcarcely making any account of Chriſtian Charity. I will hither aſcribe a place out
<pb facs="tcp:17936:7"/> of a certaine notable Booke. He that will fully and ſauourly vnderſtand the words of Chriſt, it behooues him that hee ſtudy to conforme his whole life vnto Chriſt. What doth it profit thee to diſpute on high of the Trinity, if thou want humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from whence thou maiſt diſpleaſe the Trinity? If thou kneweſt the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the ſayings of all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, whar would all this profit thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loue of God, and grace? Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity, beſides the loue of God and his ſeruice only. Knowledge without the feare of God, what doth it import? If I knew all things which are in the world, and were not in charity, what would it helpe me before God? By how much the more and better thy knowledge is, by ſo much the more grieuous and heauy from thence ſhall bee thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnleſſe thou liue the more holily. Be not therefore lifted vp for any Art or Science, but rather feare for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is giuen vnto thee. Hither alſo pertaineth a place of <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> Whereto pertaines it to diſpute how many wayes ſinne may be taken, whether it be onely a priuation, or elſe a blemiſh inherent in the ſoule: let the Diuine rather labour this, that all men may abhor and hate ſin.
<pb facs="tcp:17936:8"/> Wee contend without end, what diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth the Father from the Sonne, and both of them from the holy Ghoſt, <hi>res an relatio,</hi> and how it can be that they ſhould bee called three, of whom there can bee none which is other, ſeeing they are one eſſence: how much doth it more pertaine to the purpoſe, to labour this by all meanes, that we worſhip and adore god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and holilty that Trinity, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty it is not lawfull to ſearch into, and that wee expreſſe the vnſpeakeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thereof by our concord, as farre as we may, ſo that hereafter it may come to paſſe, that wee may be taken into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip thereof? We diſpute, how it can be, that the fire with which the ſoules of the wicked ſhall bee tormented, ſeeing it is materiall, can worke vpon an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall thing: how much more did it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne to labour with all our ſtrength to this end, leſt that fire finde any thing in vs, which it may burne, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>But I ſay, againe, that the thing it ſelfe is not taxed, but the abuſe of the thing: it is well done, that our endeuour and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſpent on the accurate knowledge of the Articles of the Faith: it is well done, that the Orthodoxe doctrine is defended againſt Hereſies, if ſo be that the ſumme
<pb facs="tcp:17936:8"/> and perfection of Chriſtian Religion bee not thought to conſiſt therein, if ſo bee alſo there bee a reſpect had of Chriſtian I fe and charity. There is an ill life where there is not a good beliefe in God: and againe, it is an vnprofitable beliefe, where there is not a good life: there is no true faith within, where workes doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare without: they that walke not in the light, are not the ſonnes of light: they are not Chriſtians which doe not lead a life worthy of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>That therefore in this moſt cold old age of the world, I might put to ſome heate to Piety, that is almoſt extinct, that I might put to a goad or ſomewhat that would pricke forward, to thoſe that are ſlow in the way of the Lord, and that I might admoniſh my ſelfe and others of our duty, I haue written this little Booke of holy meditations at ſucceſſiues houres, inſiſting in the foot-ſteps of <hi>Auguſtine, Bernard, Anſelme, Tauler,</hi> and others in this kinde, whoſe ſayings I doe diuers times vſe in this Enchyridon, yet no where (which might moſt eaſily haue bin done) doe I put to the names of the Authors, ſeldome note the places of Scriptures; for I did feare, leſt thereby the meditation of thoſe that read, might be troubled. I doe
<pb facs="tcp:17936:9"/> not think that it skils much to be known, whether any thing bee expreſt in the words of the Fathers, or in mine, ſo that that which is ſpoken be diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto. If it pleaſe any one to attribute all things that are ſpoken fitly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently in this little Booke to the holy Fathers, and to aſſigne thoſe things vnto me which are vttered nothing ſo fitly, I doe not ſtand againſt it; that onely I ſeeke, that ſome fruit may redound from thence to the ſonnes of the Church: and truely I ſhall thinke I haue my wiſh, if out of the reading of this Booke, ſome one godly &amp; holy cogitation do ariſe but in one ſoule, at one moment. If any man meet with words that are not ſo pure, ſo fitly vſed, I ſay moreouer with words that are not ſo fitly agreeing with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith (which yet I hope he ſhall not) let him not ſtraightway caſt away the whole Booke, nor ſtraightway marke me for an Hereticke, but let him weigh the kinde of writing. I handle holy things, which doe not much deſire Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall ornaments: I write Homilies, not exact diſputations; I would haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of things, then of words. Thou ſhalt not finde here thornie and knotty queſt ons, but earneſt exhortations to
<pb facs="tcp:17936:9"/> holy life: thou ſhalt not finde here ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous conceits, but the ſpirituall riches of the inward man: thou ſhalt not finde here, that which may exerciſe thee in the ſubtility of diſputing, but that which may inſtruct thee in the way of humility. I doe ſometimes follow Allegories, not that I thinke that all things muſt bee transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Allegories, but becauſe this kinde of writing, being directed to teach and admoniſh, not to ſtriuing and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, did not ſeeme to refuſe them, but why do I ſpeake more about this matter, and why doe I bring ſo many things to defend my ſelfe? ſeeing I haue already ſatisfied the indifferent Readers; but I ſhall bee neuer able to ſatisfie the vniuſt Cenſurers.</p>
            <p>Now to you <hi>(moſt famous, wiſe and prudent men)</hi> doe I dedicate and offer theſe holy meditations, that there may be ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like teſtimony extant of mine obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance towards your Honours, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in preſeruing of the purity of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is knowne of all, and praiſed of all, your ſingular prudence in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth, your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence towards all that are lettered, theſe and ſuch like things haue eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me, that I ſhould not doubt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb facs="tcp:17936:10"/> theſe firſt fruits of my ſtudies, ſuch as they be, this vſury of my winters reſt, ſuch as it is, to your Honors, with due ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of reuerence, and ſpecially ſeeing by my grandfathers, on the fathers and on the mothers ſide, of godly memory, ſome of your Honors famous Order doe come neere vnto mee in conſanguinity and affinity. Take therefore <hi>(moſt excellent Men)</hi> with a cheerefull countenance and indifferent minde, this paper gift from my tenuity, receiue me into your protection, and goe forward to fauour my ſtudies as heretofore, ſo hereafter. I beſeech the good great God, with humble ſighes, that he will continue your good things vnto you, that is, that hee vouchſafe moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably to preſerue the holy pledge of his Word, peace and tranquillity, an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py increaſe of the Common wealth, and all thoſe good things which he hath moſt largely beſtowed on your City, and that he vouchſafe alſo to paſſe them ouer to your poſterity.</p>

There (O Lord) is mine heart and there is my treaſure, there art thou, and there would thy ſeruant be alſo. Vnto which place of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thy glorious Kingdome, that I may come, Giue grace (O deare
